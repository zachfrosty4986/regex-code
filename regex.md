Regular expressions (regex) are like a secret language for pattern matching within text. They allow you to define complex search patterns that can be incredibly powerful in data validation, text processing, and more examples!

## Summary

In this file, we explore a regex pattern designed to match email addresses. The regex is crafted to handle most standard email formats and variations commonly seen in practice, each component will be broken down to its specific parts to further explain it!

## Regex Components

/^[\w.-]+@[a-zA-Z]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/

### Anchors

Anchors specify positions in the text where matches must occur, such as ^ for the start of the line and $ for the end of the line. This essentially closes in the code inside the regex line. 

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character or group must be present for a match, like + for one or more occurrences and * for zero or more. Here we only use plus becaus ethere are several components we need included within an email address. 

### Grouping Constructs

Grouping constructs ( ) are used to create subexpressions within a larger regex, allowing you to apply quantifiers or capture matches. We do not need these because we have a couple bracket expressions.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions [ ] define sets of characters to match against, such as [a-z] for any lowercase letter or [0-9] for any digit. We use these to define the parameters of the characters within each email address.

### Character Classes



### The OR Operator

### Flags

### Character Escapes
