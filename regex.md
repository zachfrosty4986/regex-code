Regular expressions (regex) are like a secret language for pattern matching within text. They allow you to define complex search patterns that can be incredibly powerful in data validation, text processing, and more examples!

## Summary

In this file, we explore a regex pattern designed to match email addresses. The regex is crafted to handle most standard email formats and variations commonly seen in practice, each component will be broken down to its specific parts to further explain it!

## Regex Components

/^[\w.-]+@[a-zA-Z]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/

### Anchors

Anchors specify positions in the text where matches must occur, such as ^ for the start of the line and $ for the end of the line. This essentially closes in the code inside the regex line.
